# Cyber Skills Level Up @ UPM

This is the first time attending a cybersecurity workshop.

Me, qs202a and wx_11 went bus for 5 hours from Johor to Serdang, Selangor just for this workshop.

In the workshop, we have a CTF event. I almost solved the last forensic challenge. Unfortunately, I've left with just one last step. We still managed to get top 6 in the end :P

The writeup will go from hardest to easiest challenges order.

## Skyfall

Description

1. Type: #forensic #crypto #re
2. Desc: I don't know how much Adele loves the Skyfall x Lewis Hamilton edit. She downloaded something about it from a Lewis Hamilton fan website. Now, Adele has lost the flag for this challenge...
3. Tools:
   - Wireshark
   - [pyintstractor](https://pyinstxtractor-web.netlify.app/)
   - [pylingual](https://pylingual.io/)
   - cyberchef.io
4. File:
   `pcap` and `encrypted_flag.txt`

---

##### How to solve?

- The key word is she **downloaded something**, and we were provided with a pcap file. So, we use wireshark to filter http.request and we found out she downloaded these:

noticed how the file is sus, we can recover the file using pyinstractor to turn it into pyc and pylingual to turn it to python.

After we get the python read the code, I found out that it was encrypting the flag using AES encryption with time.

Noticed the time we get from wireshark when the user downloaded the file?

turn that into epoch format using online converter, and last is trial and error.

After we got the key, use cyberchef to decrypt it.

## Dr Mal

Description

1. Type: #misc
2. Desc: donno why Dr. Mal write his report in Lorem Ipsum kinda language
3. Tools:
   - olevba
   - cyberchef
4. File:
   `dotm`

Flag:
||CSLU{now_you_kn0w_h0w_maldoc_workzz555z}||

---

- Use `olevba` to scan the `dotm` file and found a weird text.

- it's a powershell script, but when you go to the github link:

```powershell
$flag = 67, 83, 76, 85, 123, 110, 111, 119, 95, 121, 111, 117, 95, 107, 110, 48, 119, 95, 104, 48, 119, 95, 109, 97, 108, 100, 111, 99, 95, 119, 111, 114, 107, 122, 122, 53, 53, 53, 122, 125
$msg = 65, 100, 100, 45, 84, 121, 112, 101, 32, 45, 65, 115, 115, 101, 109, 98, 108, 121, 78, 97, 109, 101, 32, 39, 83, 121, 115, 116, 101, 109, 46, 87, 105, 110, 100, 111, 119, 115, 46, 70, 111, 114, 109, 115, 39, 10, 91, 83, 121, 115, 116, 101, 109, 46, 87, 105, 110, 100, 111, 119, 115, 46, 70, 111, 114, 109, 115, 46, 77, 101, 115, 115, 97, 103, 101, 66, 111, 120, 93, 58, 58, 83, 104, 111, 119, 40, 34, 89, 111, 117, 39, 118, 101, 32, 98, 101, 101, 110, 32, 104, 97, 99, 107, 101, 100, 46, 32, 68, 111, 110, 39, 116, 32, 114, 117, 110, 32, 109, 97, 108, 100, 111, 99, 33, 34, 41

$combinedString = -join ($msg | ForEach-Object { [char]$_ })

Invoke-Expression $combinedString
```

Just decrypt the `$flag` using cyberchef
